--> Order of log level events in extent reports:

      1st -  fail
      2nd -  skip
      3rd -  warning
      4th -  pass
      5th -  info

--> different attributes for test :
                               Author, Category, Device
* we don't need to maintain any order, it can br like,
                               .assignCategory("Smoke")
                               .assignAuthor("Harry Potter")
                               .assignDevice("Edge 109")

--> Extent Report Configuration
    * reporter(sparkReporter) is helping you to create report so, you'll be making configuration changes to spark reporter.
    * we can even do the same to the extent report obj but it has only one kind of configuration.
    *for reporter we can make multiple reports.
